I am a computer science educator in the San Dieguito Union High School District, where I teach AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and Machine Learning. I have 30+ years of experience in information technology and software development—including roles at Qualcomm and as Principal System Architect at Agrilynk—I integrate industry practices directly into my classroom. Additionally, I serve as associate faculty at MiraCosta College and as a Teacher Fellow here at UC San Diego’s COSMOS summer program, emphasizing equity, inclusivity, and project-based learning.
